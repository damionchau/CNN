#Always open the Powershell as Administrator

#Download the zip file from here
# https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-python/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
# and unload it to C:\openai-quickstart-python-master>

#Obtain your OPENAI_API_KEY from here: 
# https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application
# Under the "Add your API key" section, there is a button for you to generate the key.

#Create your .env file
cd openai-quickstart-python
cp .env.example .env

#Edit the newly created .env file and add this line:
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-cKGw4MBXE3EnYOUR_OWN_KEY_HERE"

#Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

#Activate the path to the virtual environment
#Instead of running the following lines:
# . venv/bin/activate
#Run this line for Windows: 
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

#Install all packages needed for the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
  # Note: you may have to upgrade your numpy using this command:
